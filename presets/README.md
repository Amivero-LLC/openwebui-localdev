# Preset Backups

These files are backup exports from AmiChat. After you start the environment, upload them manually in AmiChat to restore the pre-defined Workspace Models and Bedrock Connection models.

Keeping these backups in source control makes it easier to share consistent presets across environments. Remember that uploading is still required before the presets become available in the running instance.
